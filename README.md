# Periodic-table-in-C-language

This project represents the elements of the periodic table using two data structures:
1.Multi-linked lists
2.Binary search trees

The main theme of the project is to store,search & display the information of various elements by using a multi linkedlist and a binary search tree . Since,the average time complexity of searching in binary search tree is O(logn) and therefore it is more efficient in searching  elements than the multi linked list whose average time complexity of searching is O(no of rows+no of columns).
